## My process


### Built with
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) -  CSS library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)-State management
- [REACT-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)-managing routing within a react app
- [FRAMER-MOTION](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion)- for animation

### What I learned

I learnt about framer-motion and used it for implementing the animations present in this project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```jsx
    <motion.img src={src} animate={{ rotate:360 }} transition={{ ease:"linear" , duration:3,repeat:Infinity }} className="absoluete top-0"/>
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about framer-motion and its limitless possibilities.

### Useful resources

- [FRAMER-MOTION](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - This documentation helped me understand framer-motion and its implementation process
